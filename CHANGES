    Add Patch from Pablo J. Rogina:
    [PATCH] Proof of concept to use Qt Designer and .ui files for GUI
    Using Qt Designer to create .ui files will allow DFF to have a graphical way to design GUI components
    
    Also:
    Delete of api/gui/widget/selectdevices.py
    In top level CMakeLists.txt:
     - Adds a new check for pyuic4.
     - Creates a new macro to convert XML ui files to Python files only in build dir.
    
    Usage of .ui files enables fast translation and graphical preview of what is to be translated using Qt linguist tool.
